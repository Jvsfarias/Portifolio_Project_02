# Portifolio_Project_02
This is my second project using HTML and CSS

Objective: I was looking for something to do, and i decided do the front-end part of a platform thats reward players that are logged in at website, and are playing any game.
Although, that's dont mean the real life (obviously), and i only did to practice my HTML and CSS skills... Hope you like it!
