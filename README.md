# Portifolio_Project_02
This is my second project using HTML and CSS

Objective: I was looking for something to do, and I decided to do the front-end part of a platform thats reward players who are logged at the website and are playing any game. The Rewards, are NFT Items and anyone can get them. Although, that's don't mean the real life (obviously), i only did to practice my HTML and CSS skills... Hope you like it!
